Convolutional Neural Networks
Self-driving cars can improve and exceed the human ability to drive and help
in saving thousands of lives each year. A steep increase in computational
capabilities in recent years has boosted the growth in various autonomous
driving attempts. The increased ability to train deep neural network have
played a crucial role in self driving cars helping it to make important realtime
decisions accurately. the machine learning algorithms are extensively
used to find the solutions to various challenges arising in self-driving cars.
With the incorporation of various sensors coupled with the machine learning
techniques self-driving system can accomplish new tasks. The existing approaches
in semi-autonomous driving cars help the drivers with many options
such as blind spot monitoring, pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control
and lane departure warning. The motivation of the project is
to create a system that could self-learn to drive in each environment. The project is
narrowed and focused the aim to predict steering angle using Convolutional
Neural nets and to build a system that learns to drive by observing. 
Using the power of neural networks, this project approaches the
problem of self-driving cars by predicting the steering angle as the training
signal and output.
